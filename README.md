How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

- I can ensure that my code, program, and software is functional and secure through testing. A great form of testing is JUnit tests, which can provide great insight to where there may issues in your code. By being meticulous and diligent, you can write functional and secure code.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

- I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program on a strict basis to ensure that all needs are met. Additionally, I ensure that all needs are properly met through the use of JUnit tests. By being strict and diligent with my code and my testing, I can be sure that I meet all user needs and incorporate them in to a program.

How do I approach designing software?

- I approach designing software cautiously. There can be bugs at any point and it is critical to not have a bias for your own code. That being said, it is quintessential that you test your code as much as possible, whenever there has been any changes. This ensures that your code is bug-free and secure.
